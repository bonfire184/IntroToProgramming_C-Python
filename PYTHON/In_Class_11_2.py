MULTILINE COMMENT
Similarities in Languages~
Variables, conditionals, loops, I/O
Variables - Python flexible
  
C++     int a = 5;

Python dynamic typing - type is assigned at run time (Interpreted Language)
C++ static typing - compiled language

Python has objects
Python Loops - iterator (could iterate over some collection - weird things such as lines in a file, letters in a string, items in a list etc

FUnctions - nice to have (not required)

Code Blocks: {}
Python: Good Indentation

Same types of variables in both
int, float, string, bool
list, tuple(read only list), dictionary


'''
#int
a = 5

#string
a = "5"

#bool
a = True

#list
a = ["a", 4, 56, "test", True, [1, 2, 3]]
print a

#TYPE FLEXIBILITY

print "Hello World"
